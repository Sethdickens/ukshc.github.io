<p>There has been a donation made by the Holmfirth singing community that we would like to use to assist singers with travelling costs. If you are interested in applying for the travel assistance grant please email us at <strong>sacredharpsheffield at gmail dot com</strong>, and give us an indication of how much your travel to the convention would cost and why you would like to be considered.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that we may only be able to partially fund travel depending on the number of applicants we have.</p>
<p>The deadline for the application is the <strong>11th August</strong>. If you have any questions please just drop us an email.</p>
