### Getting there

**Public transport**

Wherever you are staying in Brighton or Hove, getting to the venue, which is a little out of town, will be easy. The convention venue is well served by Brighton and Hove buses ([www.buses.co.uk](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buses.co.uk%2F&h=ATM73eE2bWJuTYJBDGr5FGgE_l-QZWytU4YJDErDjJ2rsFQgYqrSpK_K05ZUNa-Q1R2m3QO3olzv1-Nd9vaB0o3csAz2MLH_cK33G3ZFHDaRsl6-MFOgqQFtXOFY0YiuXW1wXgvWfG7p)). Routes 5, 5A and 5B all stop very close to the venue. They each run every 20 minutes throughout the day and evening. The services run until shortly after midnight.  
  
The three services follow the same route through Brighton and Hove city centres. They all call at major city centre stops including Churchill Square and North Street in Brighton and the Town Hall in Hove However they do not stop at Brighton or Hove train stations.   
  
It is a 10 minute (0.5 mile) walk from Brighton station to the Churchill Square bus stop then a 20 minute bus ride.  
  
Alternatively, you can walk from Hove train station to the convention venue, 16 minutes (0.8 miles).  

**Driving**

There will be a limited amount pf parking directly outside the entrance to the venue for all days of the convention. We don't think we'll use up all this space. If we do though, there is also over-spill parking on site. 

**Airports**

The nearest airport to Brighton is Gatwick, which at around 25-30 minutes on the train is definitely the best airport to head to. You can also consider Southampton, London Heathrow, or London Stansted - all of these are considerably less convenient to arrive in Brighton.
