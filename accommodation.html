Brighton is a pricey town and most of the Brighton singers don't have a spare room, but we do hope to offer some beds on floors, or places to sleep on a sofa. Our very kind singing friends from London and around have also offered to host travelling singers in more standard beds, too (London is around 50 minutes away by train.)&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like to be hosted by a singer either in Brighton or nearby, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4enNK1419Dphly2X5-gJP-IBk79xSgV89hPClM_Wgw2rxfQ/viewform?embedded=true">fill in our Google Form.</a> Do let us know too if floor crashing is (or isn't) something you'd be okay with.</p>
